# Amy.vim colorscheme

A colorscheme based on 'amy' sublime text 2 color theme.

CAUTION: This is alpha version. Currently there is no or little term and cterm support as well as many programming languages. The colorscheme has been optimized for the following languages/environments:

* PHP
* HTML
* CSS
* JS
* NERDTree

## How it looks

It's a combination of rather dark, purple/violet patterns. Looks good with DexPot and transparency (I'm using GVIM).
